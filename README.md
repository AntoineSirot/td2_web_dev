# This project contains 2 parts :

## Frontend :

This is the most developed part, it includes all caracteristics that neede to exist exept for the POST where i never understand why it didn't work.

You can create your list on your browser and modify every item in it 

## Backend :

I tried to develop my own APIs but i didn't have enough time and capacitie to finish it. There are 3 different requests that should work but i didn't fin how to test them.
